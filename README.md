 <h1 align="center">Facial Emotion Recognition with CNN</h1>

  <h2>Introduction</h2>
  <p>The Facial Emotion Recognition project utilizes advanced Deep Learning techniques, specifically Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), to identify and classify emotions expressed by human faces. Harnessing the power of Deep Learning, this project aims to improve accuracy and generalization capability in detecting emotions such as joy, sadness, anger, etc.</p>

  <h2>Project Objective</h2>
  <p>The main goal is to create a robust emotion recognition model based on CNN architectures. This model should be capable of capturing complex facial expression features and providing accurate results in various contexts. The project aims to explore the advantages of Deep Learning for more advanced emotion recognition.</p>

  <h2>Technologies Used</h2>
  <p>The project utilizes TensorFlow and Keras to implement Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs). Model training involves the use of the FER2013 emotional image dataset.</p>
